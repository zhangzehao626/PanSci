# PanSci
A Panoramic View of Cell Population Dynamics in Mammalian Aging

## Overview
Welcome to the PanSci project repository. This project presents a comprehensive single-cell transcriptome atlas profiling over 20 million cells from >600 mouse tissue samples, providing insights into cellular population dynamics across organs, sexes, genotypes, and ages.

## Data Availability
All data and materials are available for interactive exploration and download:

- Raw FASTQ files, processed count matrices, cell metadata, and gene metadata can be downloaded from NCBI GEO under accession number GSE247719 [https://0-www-ncbi-nlm-nih-gov.brum.beds.ac.uk/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE247719].
- PanSci data can be interactively accessed in the UCSC cell browser [https://mouse-pansci.cells.ucsc.edu].
- Customized data can mapped to PanSci with the Azimuth application [https://app.azimuth.hubmapconsortium.org/app/mouse-pansci.].

## Methodology
The single-cell datasets were generated using optimized EasySci, an combinatorial indexing based single-cell profiling method. This method offers full-gene-body coverage, high scalability, and low cost platform for organism-scale cell population analysis. Computational analysis pipeline to process raw EasySci data can be found here [https://github.com/JunyueCaoLab/EasySci].

## Analysis functions

### Differential aboundance analysis
To identify changes in cell populations across different conditions (e.g., age, sex, genotype), we employed differential abundance analysis. This analysis was conducted using the following steps:
- Generating organ/tissue-specific cell count matrices across individual mice.
- Normalizing cell counts against the total cell number from the corresponding organ or tissue of each replicates.
- Applying a likelihood-ratio test using the differentialGeneTest() function in Monocle2 (version 2.28.0).
- Setting criteria for significant changes: maximum false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.05 and a fold change higher than 2 between conditions.

### Differential gene expression analysis
To identify differentially expressed genes, we employed the likelihood ratio test to identify genes significantly associated with specific cell types/subtypes in a one vs. all comparison in Monocle2 (version 2.28.0). Criteria for significant changes:
- Maximum false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.05.
- Fold change higher than 2 between top-ranked and second-top clusters.
- Transcript per million over 50 in the highest-ranked cluster.
