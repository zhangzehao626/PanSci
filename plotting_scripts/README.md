## Overview
This folder containing scripts used plotting functions for major single-cell study analysis at cellular- or molecular- level.
Required packages are included in each script snippets. 

### Cellular level analysis
- UMAP visualization of cell metadata
- UMAP visualization of targeted label
- UMAP visualization of cell density
- Box plot for for cell proportion
- Heatmap for cell proportion across experimental condition
- Scatter plot for cell proportion fold change across comparasion condition
- Dot plot for cell-type-specific proportion changes
- Stacked bar plot for proportion of cell types from different lineage/organ
- Stacked bar plot with flows for cell population dynamics in different lineage/organ across age groups
- Barplot for cell type proportion fold changes between two conditions
- Volcano plot for visualizing differentially aboundant cell types

### Molecular level analysis
- UMAP visualization of targeted gene expression in each cell
- UMAP visualization of targeted gene expression density
- Heatmap for targeted gene expression across cell types/conditions
- Dot plot for targeted gene expression across cell types/conditions
- Violin plot for targeted gene expression across cell types/conditions
- Histogram for the distribution and count of differentially expressed genes across cell types/organs
- Lollipop plot for the count of differentially expressed genes
- Volcano plot for visualizing differentially expressed genes
- Stacked dotplot for visualizing differentially expressed genes across cell types/conditions
- Sankey diagram for the flow of differentially expressed genes upon perturbations
